## Lucerne-viewer

Viewer that was created for the 624 type specimens from "Museum Luzern" (formerly "Naturhistorisches Museum Luzern"). It is based on the photogrammetry-viewer by ULB-Darmstadt:
https://github.com/ULB-Darmstadt/photogrammetry-viewer

Put some actual model folders and preview images into the NML_TypeSpecimens_all_Viewer and preview_thumbnails (preview_thumbnails are not strictly necessary). 
After starting the viewer, select the specimen you want to look at using the dropdown menu in the top left corner (it includes a searchbar)

For each specimen, the sidebar includes some information from the Lucerne_Type_Collection_SwissCollNet.csv file.
